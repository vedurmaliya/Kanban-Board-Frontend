## Overview

This project is a fully functional Kanban board application designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. Inspired by platforms like Trello, it provides an intuitive interface for creating, editing, and organizing tasks into different status groups: To Do, Doing, and Done. Users can easily track the progress of their tasks and update their status using a drag-and-drop interface.

3. **Add Task**: Integration of a form to create a new task, prompting users for the title and description of the task.
4. **Edit Task**: Provides an option to edit an existing task's title and description.
5. **Delete Task**: Implements a feature to remove a task permanently.
6. **Task Status**: Empowers users to effortlessly drag and drop tasks between the To Do, Doing, and Done categories.
7. **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application is fully functional and visually coherent on mobile devices.
